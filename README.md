**💐Welcome to GadgetHaven !** I Develop a e-commerce platform for GadgetHaven, a gadget-buying
website, based on a detailed Figma design. The site features a structured
navigation bar, product categories, and individual product details pages. Key

**🟢   I have used both  context API/local storage for handling and managing data**
- To show cart in dashBoard properly I used and in details part I used LocalStorage.
- In using the cart badge in Navbar I used Context api also with Local storage.
- On clicking Add to cart on details part that data is stored in local storage, then in dashboard section the data is called from local storage and shown there.

**Some features of my website**
- The banner have a button "shop" that takes the user to the Dashboard page.
- There are a few categories of gadgets appear as a sidebar just like Figma. on clicking on that category only the product of that category will shown.
-  The “Details” page have an image of the product, name, price, details, etc according to Figma design.
-  In DahsBoard Section, there are two tabs => Cart, and WishList.
     ● Cart items appears when you click the “Cart” tab.
     ● Wish items appears by clicking the “Wish List” tab.
- Clicking the Purchase button Congratulate Modal is shown. Then the cart became empty and the total price is 0.
- A d dynamic title for each page is added my on  website.      
-  the background color of Navbar is different from the background color of the navbar on other pages. This is  Implemented using useLocation() hook.
